          to create the environment for the tool to work. You can also set up locally for faster runtime.
          Note that Linux is required to run the model with conda installed for setting up and managing environments. Details can be found under the github page:

      </h3>
      <p class = "Text">
        <span>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; To use the deflicker directly, you would only need to input the media you want to process, which can either be a video file or a folder with images (as 'frames' of a video).
          Nevertheless, if the result is unsatisfactory, more advanced options could also be considered:
          <ul><li> <b>Iteration numbers</b>: you can increase the iteration numbers to increase the number of times processing the video.</li>
          <li> <b>Optical flow loss weight</b>: you can tune the optical_flow_coeff according to the intensity of flicker in your video</li>
          <li> <b>Downsample rate</b>: downsample rate can be adjusted according to your own needs. It would affect the convergence and slightly influences the quality</li>
          <li> <b>Maximum number of frames</b>: maximum_number_of_frames could be adjusted to limit the number of frames in the output. Please note that it is recommend to split long videos into several</li>
          shorter sequences as performance for longer videos is yet to be evaluated.</ul>

      </h3>
      <p class = "Text">
        <span>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; While the output still has flicker for the limit testing on the extreme light flickering example, a better result could be 
          observed in concat.mp4 generated by the model under the neural_filter folder.

          <video src="/videos/All-In-One-Deflicker/light_corridor_concat.mp4" alt="Video 1" controls></video>
         

          It is surprising to see the video in the middle has flickering issues completely eliminated despite the lowered resolution. In extreme cases like this,
          one can also consider checking the concat.mp4 in search for a optimal result.

        <span> Conclusion </span>
      </h3>
      <p class = "Text">
        <span>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; Flicking in video shooting is a very common problem that occurs when frame rate and shutter speed do not match the capture of fractions of light pulses(try shooting a video on computer screen). 
          In the past, deflickering either required manually adjusting parameters in dedicated softwares or only produced satisfactory results on specfic types of deflicking, but
          such types of issues can now be easily solved in All-In-One-Deflicker wtih significant effects on processing old cartoons, AI-generated videos and video captures.
